AI-powered chatbot built with IBM Watsonx Assistant for college admissions
# 🎓 College Admission Agent – AI Chatbot using IBM Watsonx Assistant

This is an AI-powered virtual assistant built using **IBM Watsonx Assistant**. The chatbot is designed to help prospective students, parents, and other users get quick and accurate answers to college-related queries for **MS Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences (MSRUAS)**.

The agent mimics NLP-style behavior through structured dialog actions without the use of external APIs or coding, making it both powerful and easy to maintain.

- Answers admission-related questions instantly
- Shares details on courses, fees, hostel, deadlines, and eligibility
- Simulates human-like conversations using Watsonx Assistant Actions
- Makes college information accessible 24/7 without human intervention
